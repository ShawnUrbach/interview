# mySidewalk Inc Coding Assessment




## Problems:
* The user has a file that is made up of short (less than 1000 character) strings, each on a different line (assume any common character or character combination that means a newline to someone might be used interchangeably in this file). Most of these strings will be preceded by numbers, i.e. “2 Steaks”, “10 Chicken Wings”, “343GuiltySparks”. Accept the file from the user and return them a file with the same items sorted first by the numeric value of any leading number (2 < 10 < 343) and then alphabetically for the rest of the string.

* The user wants to visualize the following geojson layers ([1](https://github.com/mysidewalk/interview/blob/master/assets/kc-neighborhoods.json), [2](https://github.com/mysidewalk/interview/blob/master/assets/kc-tracts.json)) together on a map along with a chart of their commuter population attributes in an interactive manner.
